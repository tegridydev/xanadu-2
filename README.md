# xanadu-2

xanadu-2 is a modernized revision of Ted Nelson's classic Project Xanadu

## Inspiration

The inspiration behind xanadude (xanadu-2) comes from Project XanaduÂ®, which was founded in 1960 by Ted Nelson. Project Xanadu is the original hypertext project and aimed to create a universal network of interconnected documents. It was the first project to envision a world where all kinds of information could be easily linked together, pretty cool huh.

Project Xanadu introduced concepts such as visible connections (links) between documents, bi-directional links, and version management of information. These ideas morphed over the years into that thing called WWW or something like that!
