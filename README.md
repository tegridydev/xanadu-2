# xanadude

xanadude is a modernized version of the classic Project Xanadu, updated to run on a variety of systems

## Inspiration

The inspiration behind xanadude comes from Project XanaduÂ®, which was founded in 1960 by Ted Nelson. Project Xanadu is the original hypertext project and aimed to create a universal network of interconnected documents. It was the first project to envision a world where all kinds of information could be easily linked together, pretty cool huh.

Project Xanadu introduced concepts such as visible connections (links) between documents, bi-directional links, and version management of information. These ideas morphed over the years into that thing called WWW or something like that!
